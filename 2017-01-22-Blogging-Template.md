    <td>We were all given a manual telling us how we're supposed to publish our blogs and get our website onto the internet. I kept on reading it through before doing the next step as it was only a few pages. When I had read through it, all I had to do was start blogging! I really don’t think that we had work that was too hard, but I wouldn't call it easy! We had to do a fair bit of coding to get our backgrounds and colours working. I think I will always make sure I check my work after I have completed the task in hand. </td>

    <td>I don’t really think that there was much area for improvement as I have still got my website running. I think that I could work on my ability to write code myself instead of filling in the area needed.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I blog, I will make sure that I produce more in the lesson as then I get less homework. I will also try to keep all of my repositories tidy. Overall, I don’t think that there is much that I could improve on.</td>
